# Catsting

This neat little project uses the https://catfact.ninja/ API to do some cool stuff like display statistics, allow you to query the API for specific cat countries or coat types through a graphical interface and even generate random fun facts with a button press.

You can check it out there => https://redwannmelsa.github.io/catsting/

## fun todos

- add a load spin on the landing page until the stats are loaded
